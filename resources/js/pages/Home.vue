        There is an old saying, “Everything has its place.” Go into any suburban
        home in post-modern day era, and you most likely will find a basement,
        an attic, a closet, a garage, or even a shed full of items which have
        outlasted their initial use. It seems that most households in America
        will replace their ell phone every six months, a kitchen appliance once
        a year, and then there is the question of what to do that occasional
        oddball item which someone may give us as a gift, yet serves no
        immediate purpose in our household.
